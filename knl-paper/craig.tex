yar\todo{Discuss, broadly, what class of problems this resides in and why humanity works on it}

yar2\todo{some basic intro to the linear algebra you are doing}

yar3\todo{any nuances of porting to MIC?}

yar4\todo{discussion of scalability observed}

\missingfigure{Strong scaling of the GPs on a single MIC (e.g. problem size constant
and increasing number of threads)}

Finally, some discussion is needed: is DG ameniable to MICs? Vs typical CPUs? I
naively guess so, since you can essentially vectorize several of the
activities.
