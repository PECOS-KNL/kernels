\section{Applications and Scientific Kernels}
\label{sec:apps}

The following subsections aim to highlight the two major targets of this work: 1) the level of effort
required in porting software applications from a variety of scientific
disciplines written in commonly used procedural languages; and 2) the observed
performance of these applications.  Applications are drawn from four 
scientific disciplines:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Incompressible fluid dynamics}:  PoongBack is a Fortran application
targeted towards solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a
periodic wall-bounded channel.  PoongBack uses a Fourier spectral
discretisation in the periodic directions and a B-spline discretisation in the
wall-bounded direction.

\item {\bf Uncertainty quantification}:  QUESO is a C++ library for the
Quantifying Uncertainty in Estimation, Simulation, and Optimization.  It
provides a suite of algorithms for sampling unknown probability distributions
and provides a parallel (MPI) environment to allow the user to leverage this in
large-scale applications.  %We evaluate a specific likelihood function called a Gaussian Process surrogate and leverage OpenMP and MKL for the dense linear algebra involved.

\item {\bf Computational chemistry}:  CFOUR is a collection of Fortran
applications that leverage a suite of algorithms for solving coupled-cluster
problems in quantum chemistry.

\item {\bf High order methods}:  ArcSyn3sis is a C/C++ library that implements
a blended isogeometric discontinuous Galerkin (BIDG) method that seamlessly
blends the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method with isogeometric analysis.

\end{itemize}
%Given findings from 1) the level of effort required porting this software; and 2) observed performance, our goal will be to comment on the feasibility of the use of accelerators for doing computational science.  The of this section will explore each of the application areas mentioned above. --CEM - IS this suppose to say something not already said in the first paragraph?
