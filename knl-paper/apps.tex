\section{Applications and Scientific Kernels}
\label{sec:apps}

The subsections which follow highlight two things: 1) the level of effort
required in porting software applications from a wide array of scientific
disciplines written in commonly used procedural languages; and 2) observed
performance of these applications.  Applications are drawn from four distinct
scientific disciplines:

\paragraph{Incompressible fluid dynamics}  Poongback is a Fortran application
targeted towards solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a
periodic wall-bounded channel.

\paragraph{Uncertainty quantification}  QUESO is a C++ library for the
Quantifying Uncertainty in Estimation, Simulation, and Optimization.  It
provides a suite of algorithms for sampling unknown probability distributions
and provides a parallel (MPI) environment to allow the user to leverage this in
large-scale engineering applications.

\paragraph{Computational chemistry}  CFOUR is a collection of Fortran
applications that leverages a suite of algorithms for solving coupled-cluster
problems in quantum chemistry.

\paragraph{Finite element methods}  ArcSyn3sis is a C++ library that implements
a blended isogeometric discontinuous Galerkin (BIDG) method that seamlessly
blends the discontinuous Galerkin method with isogeometric analysis.

We explore each of these applications in turn.
