\section{Applications and Scientific Kernels}
\label{sec:apps}

The subsections which follow highlight two things: 1) the level of effort
required in porting software applications from a wide array of scientific
disciplines written in commonly used procedural languages; and 2) observed
performance of these applications.  Applications are drawn from four distinct
scientific disciplines.

\paragraph{Poongback}  Poongback is a Fortran application targeted towards
solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic wall-bounded
channel.

\paragraph{C4}  C4 is a collection of Fortran applications that leverages a
suite of algorithms for solving coupled-cluster problems in quantum chemistry.

\paragraph{QUESO}  QUESO is a C++ library for the Quantifying Uncertainty in
Estimation, Simulation, and Optimization.  It provides a suite of algorithms
for sampling unknown probability distributions and provides a parallel (MPI)
environment to allow the user to leverage this in large-scale engineering
applications.

\paragraph{ArcSyn3sis}  ArcSyn3sis is a C library that implements a
discontinuous Galerkin method that respects complex geometries.

We explore each of these applications in turn.
