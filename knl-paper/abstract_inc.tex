This paper presents experiences using Intel's KNL MIC platform, focusing on
porting of existing scientific applications and micro-kernels.  Fortran, C, and
C++ applications are chosen from a wide array of scientific disciplines
including computational fluid dynamics, numerical linear algebra,
uncertainty quantification, finite-element methods, and computational chemistry.
