This paper presents experiences using Intel's KNL MIC platform, focusing on
porting of existing scientific applications and micro-kernels.  Fortran, C, and
C++ applications are chosen from a wide array of scientific disciplines
including numerical linear algebra, uncertainty quantification, finite-element
methods, computational chemistry, and the core compute kernels used in the
direct numerical simulation of turbulence.
