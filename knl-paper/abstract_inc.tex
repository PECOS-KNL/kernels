This paper presents experiences using an early development
environment release of the forthcoming Intel MIC platform, focusing on
 porting of existing scientific applications and micro-kernels.  Fortran
 and C++ applications are chosen from disciplines\todo{update apps}
 including numerical linear algebra, gaussian processes, finite-element
 analysis, and the core compute kernels used in the direct numerical
 simulation of turbulence.
