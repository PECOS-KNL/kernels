This paper presents experiences using Intel's KNL MIC platform on early-access
hardware for the upcoming Stampede 2 cluster launching in Summer 2017. We focus
on 1) porting of existing scientific software; 2) observing performance of this
software.  Additionally, we comment on both the ease of use of KNL and observed
performance of KNL as compared to previous generation ``Knights Ferry'' and
``Knights Corner'' Xeon Phi MICs~\cite{schulz2012early}.  Fortran, C, and C++
applications are chosen from a variety of scientific disciplines including
computational fluid dynamics, numerical linear algebra, uncertainty
quantification, finite element methods, and computational chemistry.
